# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Replace the app’s current mascot/logo with a new mascot derived from the uploaded hand-drawn sketch, adding a subtle red accent while preserving the sketch aesthetic.

**Planned changes:**
- Create a new square, transparent PNG mascot asset derived from `Untitled_Artwork.jpeg`, with a subtle red accent, centered with padding for small-size usage.
- Update mascot/logo usage in `HeroSection`, `TopNav`, and `FooterSection` to reference the new generated mascot asset while keeping existing English alt text consistent with the brand name.

**User-visible outcome:** The site displays the new hand-drawn mascot (with a subtle red accent) consistently in the hero, navigation, and footer.
